# Classifying-JWST-HST-galaxy-mergers-with-CNNs
This project uses images from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can tell whether a galaxy is currently merging with another or not. Merging galaxies often have distorted shapes, tidal tails, or multiple bright cores, while non-merging ones look more undisturbed.

The goal is to teach the model to spot these features automatically, making it easier for astronomers to sift through huge datasets and study how galaxy collisions influence the universe’s evolution.

#I independently reproduced and extended a published CNN-based galaxy merger classification pipeline, focusing on understanding astropy-based data handling and telescope-specific effects.#

Inspired from this article which is more like a tutorial for this project: https://spacetelescope.github.io/hellouniverse/notebooks/hello-universe/Classifying_JWST-HST_galaxy_mergers_with_CNNs/Classifying_JWST-HST_galaxy_mergers_with_CNNs.html
